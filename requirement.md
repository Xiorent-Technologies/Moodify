Overview:
Moodify is an AI-driven music recommendaƟon mobile applicaƟon that creates personalized
SpoƟfy playlists based on a user’s current emoƟonal state. It uses natural language mood
input, pre-defined emoƟonal tags, and contextual data to intelligently match moods with
music via SpoƟfy API. The core AI engine is powered by GPT (OpenAI) to understand user
senƟment, detect emoƟonal tone, and convert it into relevant musical parameters.
The mobile app will feature a premium yet modern interface with subtle gradients,

animaƟons, and dark-mode inspired aestheƟcs, appealing to both tech-savvy and music-
centric audiences.
